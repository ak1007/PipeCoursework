Although Pipe currently includes a Dnamaca module, the module is only
an interface to the actual Dnamaca tool which is written in C++.

This tool was developed by Dr William Knottenbelt of Imperial College,
London, and is not distributed with Pipe.

If you wish to experiment with using Dnamaca to perform passage time
analysis with Pipe, please contact Dr Knottenbelt or Nick Dingle:
